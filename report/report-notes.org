- maybe sum should use long (m3)
- choice of data structures
  - LongAdder good for high contention
  - using ConcurrentSkipListSet for the n log n "free" in threads
    - alternative is eventually sorting in main thread at n log n cost
      - but in one thread
- if there are any misformed files in the dataset, threads will
  silently fail
  - because runtime/unchecked exceptions are silently ignored
  - for example, if file
- readline + splitting is bad if there is a large number of
  ... numbers, on a line
