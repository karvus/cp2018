		* If a file starts with the string "SKIP", the consumer does not process
		  it.
		* If a file starts with the string "TERM", the consumer terminates
		  immediately (printing on screen the sum of the lengths of all files
		  visited so far).
		* If a consumer terminates because of "TERM", then the consumer starts
		  another consumer.
	
	- Make sure that all consumers terminate when the shared blocking deque is
	  empty and no more files will be added to it.
