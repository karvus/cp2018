	- Write a method that finds all text files (files with a ".txt" suffix) in a given directory.
	- Whenever a text file is found, launch a task in an executor and get a future for the task's result.
	- The task should compute how many times the letter "a" is present in the file, and return it as an integer.
	- The main thread should wait for all futures to complete and print on screen the sum of all results.
